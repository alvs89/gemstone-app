## 📱 Project Description
GemStone is a fully functional, front-end e-commerce mobile application built using the Flutter framework. This project serves as a laboratory activity demonstrating advanced mobile development concepts, including global state management, interactive Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) design, dynamic mathematical algorithms, and robust input validation. 

The application provides a seamless, premium shopping experience tailored for the Philippine market, featuring local e-wallet integrations and standard VAT calculations.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm:** The product price automatically recalculates in real-time based on the selected precious metal (Blue, White Gold, Yellow Gold, Platinum, Rose Gold) and ring size variations.
* **Synchronized Image Carousel:** A swipeable product gallery that mathematically syncs with the user's material selection in the configuration menu.
* **Global Cart State Management:** Items can be customized, added, explicitly selected via checkboxes, and safely deleted (with confirmation dialogs) across different application screens.
* **Progressive Checkout Flow:** A clean, stepped UI for the checkout process featuring an itemized receipt (subtotal, insured shipping, and 12% VAT).
* **Robust Form Validation:** Built-in Regex and conditional logic to ensure accurate data entry for Names, Emails, Shipping Addresses, and Philippine mobile numbers.
* **Localized Payment Gateways:** Dedicated UI selections for prominent local payment methods including GCash, Maya, Credit/Debit Card, and Cash on Delivery (COD).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** Flutter
* **Language:** Dart
* **Architecture:** Stateful/Stateless Widgets with Global Variable State Management
* **Design System:** Material Design 3
